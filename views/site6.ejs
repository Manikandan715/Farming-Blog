          </a>
          <p>Paddy is cultivated at least twice a year in most parts of India, the two seasons being known as Rabi and Kharif respectively. The former cultivation is dependent on irrigation, while the latter depends on the Monsoon. The paddy cultivation plays a major role in socio-cultural life of rural India.</p><br>
            <p>More than half of the world’s population consumes rice as their staple food.  Despite being grown in a variety of agro-climatic areas, rice is the most commonly used food in Southeast Asia. In India, rice planting is typically farmed in six distinct habitats, including coastal lowlands, deep water areas, rainfed lowlands, rainfed uplands, irrigated kharif and irrigated rabi. Gain a thorough understanding of how to grow paddy crops to boost your farm productivity. </p><br>
                 <p>The most common sign of crop maturity is a change in straw colour from green to yellow. At this point, the panicle’s grain begins to mature from top to bottom. In general, the lower portion of the plant should still be green while harvesting to prevent shattering. If harvesting is performed by a combined harvester, threshing occurs simultaneously. However, if harvested manually, then the rice should be bundled and threshed using a thresher.</p>
