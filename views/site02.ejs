          <a href="#">CORN GROWING
          </a>
          <p>While there are many varieties of corn, there are two general categories — sweet corn, which is often eaten as a vegetable, and field corn, which is meant for feed and other products. While farmers harvest sweet corn young so the kernels are still fresh, field corn’s harvest date doesn’t occur until the kernels have dried.</p><br>
            <p>Like many other types of grains, corn needs a few elements to thrive:

                Sunlight: Grow corn in a sunny spot. It needs full sun, or at least six hours of direct sunlight, each day.
                Soil: Corn thrives when the soil conditions are just right. The soil should have a pH between 5.5 and 7. When the soil is too acidic, the plants won’t get the nutrients they need. The ideal soil also drains well, meaning it doesn’t become too soggy or water-logged when it rains.
                Water: Speaking of water, corn plants need enough but not too much of it. If conditions are very wet, and there’s too much water in the soil, the plants’ roots can rot. When conditions are too dry, the plants will wilt and struggle to produce ears.
                Fertilizer: The right fertilizer helps ensure corn plants get the nutrients they need to thrive. Use up to three pounds of fertilizer for every 100 square feet you plant.</p><br>
                 <p>Before planting corn, focus on preparing the soil in the area. Remove weeds and large stones or other pieces of debris. Working the top 10 inches of soil before planting will make it loose enough to aid germination and help the roots thrive. If you aren’t sure of the soil’s quality, send it out for testing. A soil test will let you know the pH and the minerals the soil contains.

                    Corn does best when planted in short — not long — rows. It’s better to have several shorter rows, placed side-by-side, than one long row. Planting in a square pattern helps the corn cross-pollinate. To ensure the corn grows correctly, it’s a good idea to plant one variety in a single area, rather than two or more.</p>
