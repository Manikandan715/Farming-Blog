        <a href="#">TEA GROWING
        </a>
        <p>Conventional tea farming; kankō saibai] is the mode for tea farming that is commonly applied in 
          industrial and large scale, contemporary cultivating contexts. The tea that is available on the 
          market in Japan is, if not by default, grown according to conventional farming methods, and thus 
          it is this kind of tea that can be readily obtained at local supermarkets and prestigious tea 
          vendors alike. This way of farming does not eschew the use of chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals
           such as pesticides and herbicides, and applies them in correspondence to the requirements for the 
           seasons and environmental circumstances. Although the allowed substances are listed in an official 
           decree issued by the Japanese government, there is no limit to the amount and frequency on which 
           these substances can be applied, leaving it up to the judgment of the farmers themselves to decide
            what is appropriate.

          <p>As indicated in the previous chapter, the contemporary focus on a lush umami flavor in green tea
             is what demands from manufacturers a dedicated approach to enhance the amino value in the product
              they create. Apart from the traditional shading techniques, an advance in our understanding of 
              chemistry has made it possible to devise substances that can artificially aid the producer with this 
              objective. The downside of this however, is that the tea industry is digging itself deeper and deeper 
              in an endless vicious circle. The desire for a stronger umami flavor demands from the manufacturer that 
              he employs measureless amounts of chemical substances to, somewhat forcibly, ‘fatten’ his crops. Such 
              juicy crops of course look just as appealing to harmful termites and other little vermin that invite 
              themselves to nibble away on the vulnerable tea buds prior to harvest. This nullifies the effect of the 
              thorough care the manufacturer has taken in inseminating his garden, and calls for more radical approaches.
               This time he sprays his garden with chemicals that repel bugs and other pests and scourges.</p><br>
               <p>Organic tea farming;essence omits the use of any agrochemicals and most chemical 
                fertilizers. Instead substances that are of a ‘natural’ nature (ea. not chemically altered)
                 are used. Examples of substances that are often employed by tea growers in Japan are
                  animal-, or plant-base fertilizers such as livestock excrements, fishmeal, bone meal, oil
                   cake from rapeseed, compost, straw and other natural materials such as fallen leaves and 
                   branches, and pampas grass.</p>
